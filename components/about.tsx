        <p className="mb-3">
          A recent computer science co-op graduate from the University of Prince Edward Island &#40;UPEI&#41; with a track record of reliability and a strong understanding of computer fundamentals 🎓.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          Some guiding principles of my tech journey thus far have been <span className="italic">persistence</span> and <span className="italic">curiosity</span> &#40;and perhaps a bit of stubbornness at times as well 🐥&#41;. A well-versed Python developer, I also have experience working with languages such as 
          Java and C. Additionally, I <span className="font-bold underline">love</span> using CLI Tools, API Tools, CI/CD-Tools, and Web Scraping Tools to further enhance automation capabilities 🙌. 
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          As a recent grad looking to kickstart their tech career, I am currently looking for a <span className="font-medium">full-time position</span> in <span className="underline">DevOps-Related</span> and <span className="underline">Cybersecurity-Related</span> realms, as that is where I beleive my expertise could be best applied 🍀. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="italic">Outside of developing my computer knowledge</span>, I enjoy going to the gym, watching football, reading &#40;primarily about finance and politics&#41;, and exploring the world 🏋️‍♂️⚽️📕✈️.
